<p>This is a version of CreateJS that we have been modifying over the last 10 years.  
It is based on CreateJS 1.0 (ES5 - not ES6 - which as far as we know, has not been fully developed).</p>
<p>Look for danzen in the code to see the dozen or so updates.
Many of the updates have also been updated in the CreateJS Github where we do some maintenance.</p>
<p>Generally, ZIM works with the official CreateJS except for ZIM TextureActives which needs this version.
The offical release is hosted on the Adobe CDN and is used with Adobe Animate. 
However, multitouch and retina adjustments make using our version a little more stable.
Retina (devicePixelRatio) makes you have to adjust for stage scale for mouse positions in the official CreateJS.
The ZIM version adjusts for that.</p>
<p>Note - that ZIM has ZIM Shim for Adobe Animate and you can use this version of CreateJS with that too.</p>
