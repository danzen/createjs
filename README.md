<p><em>ZIM at https://zimjs.com is a general JavaScript Canvas Framework that is powered by CreateJS.</em></p>
<p>CreateJS is a suite of modular libraries and tools which work together or independently to enable rich interactive content on open web technologies via HTML5.  See https://createjs.com. CreateJS has been stable since 2017 and generally provides containers and events for the HTML Canvas as well as preloading, sound and tweening.

<h2>ZIM FEATURES</h2>
<p>ZIM has been constantly <a href=https://zimjs.com/updates target=_blank>updating</a> since 2014 and provides many conveniences, components and controls.  
CreateJS objects are no longer used directly as ZIM extends a Container, Shape, Bitmap and MovieClip providing over 40 components and 80 additional DisplayObject methods.
<em>For a perspective, ZIM is four times the code size of CreateJS.</em>
Preloading is done in the ZIM Frame or on demand - including lazy loading.
ZIM animate() provides dozens of extra features making animation in ZIM as powerful and complete as GreenSock GSAP.  
This includes animating and dragging along user editable paths providing industry leading functionality.
Please read https://zimjs.com/about for features.</p>

<h2>THIS VERSION OF CREATEJS</h2>
<p>This repository holds a version of CreateJS that we have been modifying over the last 10 years.  
It is based on CreateJS 1.0.  Look for <em>Dan Zen</em> in the code to see the 40 (or so) updates.
Many of the updates have also been updated in the CreateJS Github where we do maintenance.</p>
<p>Generally, ZIM works with the official CreateJS except for <a href="https://zimjs.com/015" target=_blank>ZIM&nbsp;TextureActives</a> which needs this version.
The offical CDN release of CreateJS is hosted at Adobe and is used with Adobe Animate. 
However, multitouch and retina adjustments make using our version a little more stable.
In the official CreateJS, devicePixelRatio makes you have to adjust for stage scale for mouse positions.
The ZIM version adjusts for that.</p>
<p>Note, there is ZIM Shim for Adobe Animate and you can use this version of CreateJS with ZIM Shim to export from Animate to ZIM.</p>
